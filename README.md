# bash-style-guide

My personal style guide for Bash.

## Context

This will basically be a bunch of notes/bullet points on Bash until I get the energy to organize it into something coherent; this is *not* meant to be a definitive style guide (at least not yet). I'm mostly going to be rambling here because I just want to get these thoughts out of my head as fast as I can, and clean it up later.

## Notes
